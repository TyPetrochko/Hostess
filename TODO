10) Start debugging grind
11) Is there an async loadbalancer?

housekeeping stuff:
- clean up code, remove comments
- rename "DEFAULT_PORT" to "PORT"
- make sure that requests to missing files are handled gracefully
- make sure it runs without a config file
- make sure virtualhosts still work

Speedup parameters:
 - make a larger cache
 - use larger bytebuffers for async files
